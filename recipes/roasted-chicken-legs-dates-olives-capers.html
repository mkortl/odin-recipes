    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious Ottolenghi recipe for roasted chicken. The chicken needs marinading for at least a day, preferably two, to soften and flavour properly; I wouldn't cut corners here.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 chicken legs, drumstick and thigh attached, skin on (2kg net)</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>15g	fresh oregano, torn, plus extra for garnish</li>
        <li>3 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>100g pitted green olives</li>
        <li>60g	capers, plus 2 tbsp of their juices</li>
        <li>70g	pitted and quartered lengthways palestinian medjoul dates</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>120ml dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 tbsp date syrup or treacle</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken in a large, non-reactive bowl and add all of the ingredients, apart from the wine and date molasses, along with Â¾ teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Gently mix everything together, cover the bowl and leave in the fridge to marinate for 1 to 2 days, stirring the ingredients a few times during the process.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C.</li>
        <li>Spread out the chicken legs on a large baking tray, along with all the marinade ingredients. Whisk together the wine and molasses and pour over the meat. Place in the oven and cook for 50 minutes, basting 2 or 3 times, until the meat is golden brown on top and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, transfer everything to a large platter, sprinkle over some freshly picked oregano leaves and serve.</li>
    </ol>
