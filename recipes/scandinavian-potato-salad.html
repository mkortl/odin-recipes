    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vegetarian version of <a href="https://ottolenghi.co.uk/pages/recipes/scandinavian-potato-salad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ottolenghi's recipe</a> for a nice summery potato salad. Swap the fried onions for store bought ones, if you prefer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Crisp Onions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g sunflower (or vegetable) oil, for frying</li>
        <li>1 large onion (180g), peeled and cut into very thin rounds (use a mandoline, if you have one)</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>Fine sea salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Potatoes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>700 g charlotte potatoes, or new potatoes, cut in half</li>
        <li>70 g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>10 g chives, finely chopped</li>
        <li>10 g picked dill leaves, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Pickle</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ tsp	white mustard seeds</li>
        <li>60g	sweet pickled cucumbers, thinly sliced, to garnish, plus 2 tbsp brine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, make the onions. Put the oil in a medium saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, toss the onions in the cornflour, then fry in two batches, stirring occasionally, for five to seven minutes, until golden. Drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper, then sprinkle over an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.</li>
        <li>Put the potatoes in a large pot of well-salted water and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium-high, leave to cook for 12-15 minutes, until tender, then tip into a colander. Wipe the potato pan dry and return it to a medium-high heat. Add the butter and, once that’s melted, stir in the potatoes and a good grind of black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for a minute or two, until the potatoes are well coated, then take off the heat and stir in all the herbs.</li>
        <li>Now for the mustard seeds. Put the mustard seeds and two tablespoons of pickled cucumber brine in a small saucepan on a medium heat, leave to cook for three to four minutes, until mustard has puffed up and most of the liquid has been absorbed, then take off the heat.</li>
        <li>To serve, spoon the potato mix on to a platter, scatter clumps of the mustard seeds on top, followed by the sliced pickled cucumbers and, finally, a pile of crisp onions.</li>
    </ol>
