    <h1>Classic Lemon-Buttermilk Cake</h1>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cake has a fine, tender crumb and bold lemon flavor. It's brushed with syrup for extra moistness and lemony tang.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Cake</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>298 g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>300 g All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon table salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>zest (grated rind) of 3 lemons</li>
        <li>142 g unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>283 g buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>57 g lemon juice, fresh preferred</li>
        <li>14 g granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the cake: Preheat the oven to 180°C with a rack in the middle. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, salt, and baking powder.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and zest to the dry ingredients and mix at medium speed, until the mixture is uniform in texture.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until each is fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
        <li>With the mixer on low, add the buttermilk slowly. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl halfway through; then scrape again once all of the buttermilk is added. Mix at medium-high speed until any scrapings are fully combined, about 20 to 30 seconds. The batter may appear slightly curdled; that’s OK.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter into the prepared pan, and level the top with a spatula. Bake the cake for 30 minutes; it should be golden brown at the edges, beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan, and feel set all across the top. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out free of crumbs.</li>
        <li>Remove the cake from the oven, and place it on a cooling rack. Let the cake rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the cake is resting, make the syrup: Combine the juice and sugar in a microwave-safe bowl or measuring cup, or in a saucepan set over medium heat. If you’re using a microwave, heat the syrup on high power for 40 seconds. Stir the syrup; if the sugar isn’t fully dissolved, microwave in 10-second bursts, stirring in between, until the syrup is no longer grainy.</li>
        <li>Immediately brush the syrup all over the lukewarm cake. Let it soak in, then continue brushing and dabbing it on until all of the syrup is used.</li>
        <li>Serve the cake in squares, topped with whipped cream, if desired.</li>
        <li>Store leftover cake, covered, for several days at room temperature. Freeze for longer storage.</li>
    </ol>
